This project consists of two parts: the API and the frontend. The API handles requests and manages data, while the frontend interacts with the user.

## Installing Dependencies

To install all the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the API directory and install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd api && npm install && cd ..
    ```

2. **Navigate to the client directory and install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd client && npm install && cd ..
    ```

## Running the Project

1. **Start the API server:**

    ```bash
    cd api
    npm start
    ```

2. **Start the frontend:**

    ```bash
    cd client
    npm start
    ```

## Build

1. **Building the API:**

   If you need to create a production version of the API server, use the following command:

    ```bash
    cd api
    npm run build
    ```

   This will build the project for a production environment.

2. **Building the frontend:**

   To build the frontend into a production version:

    ```bash
    cd client
    npm run build
    ```

   This will create an optimized version of the client for production, ready to be deployed on a server.
